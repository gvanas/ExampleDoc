"Multi-target document example for blahtexml"
https://github.com/gvanas/ExampleDoc

This is a working, yet simple, example of a multi-target generation system for scientific documents using Blahtexml for converting equations from TeX to MathML. More information can be found in the paper "Blahtexml and multi-target document generation" (http://gva.noekeon.org/papers/2010-Blahtexml.pdf), published in the "Zpravodaj Československého sdružení uživatelů TeXu" (http://bulletin.cstug.cz/).

To make this example work, you need to have installed:
* make
* blahtexml (https://github.com/gvanas/blahtexml, http://gva.noekeon.org/blahtexml)
* xsltproc (http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/xsltproc2.html)
* LaTeX or XeLaTex (http://www.ctan.org/)

Feedback is welcome. Please refer to the website above for contact information.

Have fun!
